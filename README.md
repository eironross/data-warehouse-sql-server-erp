# ðŸš€Project Overview
- This project builds a Data Warehousing and Analytics solution that consolidates and transforms data from CSV files. Using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold), the system ensures clean, reliable data that supports business intelligence, reporting, and advanced analytics. 

## General Principle
- **Naming Conventions**: Use PascalCase as the naming convention and no spaces on each word. ie. tablename -> SalesOrder
    - Use naming of **key** instead of the **_GUID**. ie Date Keys -> DateKey
